"""
 Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
